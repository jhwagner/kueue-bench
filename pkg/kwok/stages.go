package kwok

// stages.go contains functions for managing Kwok Stage resources
// for pod lifecycle simulation. Currently, we use the pre-built
// stage-fast.yaml from Kwok releases, which provides fast pod
// lifecycle transitions suitable for testing.
//
// Future enhancements could include custom stage definitions
// for more realistic job lifecycles or failure scenarios.
